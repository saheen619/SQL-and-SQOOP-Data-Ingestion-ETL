# SQL and SQOOP Data Ingestion - ETL

### Problem Statement:
Use Sqoop to read data from SQL database and import it into Hadoop.

1. Create a SQL database on any cloud platform that supports MySQL.
2. Design an Ecommerce database and store 10 GB record in SQL Database.
3. Use Sqoop to load data from SQL Database to Hadoop.
4. Schedule pipeline such a way that new data from Database can be transferred to Hadoop automatically on daily basis.

### Project Benefits

This can be used to import data from a variety of sources, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, financial systems, and human resources (HR) systems. Once the data is in Hadoop, it can be used for a variety of purposes, such as analytics, machine learning, and data warehousing.
